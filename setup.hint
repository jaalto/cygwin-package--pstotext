sdesc: "Extract text from PostScript and PDF files"
ldesc: "Extract text (in the ISO 8859-1 character set) from a PostScript or
PDF (Portable Document Format) file. Thus, pstotext is similar to the
ps2ascii program that comes with ghostscript. The output of pstotext
is however better than that of ps2ascii, because pstotext deals better
with punctuation and ligatures."
